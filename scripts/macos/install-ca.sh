# Trust (or untrust) the Secure Edge per-device Root CA in the system
# keychain. Browsers and other TLS clients on macOS follow the system
# keychain by default, so a single install-ca run is enough to make
# Tier-2 MITM transparent to Safari, Chrome, and curl.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./install-ca.sh install <path-to-ca.crt>
#   sudo ./install-ca.sh remove  <path-to-ca.crt>
