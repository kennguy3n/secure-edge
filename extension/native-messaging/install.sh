# Chrome's Native Messaging protocol invokes the host binary with the
# caller's chrome-extension://<id>/ origin as the only positional
# argument and offers no way to inject custom flags through the host
# manifest. The agent binary detects that calling convention in main()
# and routes to Native Messaging mode automatically, so the manifest
# "path" can point directly at the production daemon binary without
# a wrapper script.

# Resolve the platform-specific install directory for Chrome stable.
# Other Chromium variants (Edge, Brave, Chromium, Opera) live in
# different per-vendor paths; users with those browsers should set
# DESTINATION manually.
